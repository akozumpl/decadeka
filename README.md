# decadeka

Deka trains her multiplications table before she can play Minecraft.

The easy multiplications (e.g. by 0 or by 1) are offered less frequently (to make it harder for the trainee).

## How to run

1. Install [scala-cli](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/install/).
2. Checkout this repo.
3. ```scala-cli <decadeka checkout dir> -- --level 10 --count 30```
